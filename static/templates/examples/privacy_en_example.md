**Last updated:** DD/MM/YYYY

[[Instance name]], referred to hereinafter as _this instance_ takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy this instance's operator provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

This website tracks basic information about it's visitors. Standard, unmodified version of Librate[[", which this website is running"]] collects the following informations: 

- IP addresses
- randomized session and device ID

for the purpose of session management, personalization and preventing abuse. This data is stored until you log out, however in the future an opt-in setting to require confirmation of sign-in attempts from unknown locations, which would require persisting such data until a saved client is removed by the user.
No sensitive data, as defined by General Data Protection Regulation is collected. 
  [[Additionally, the modified version used by this instance (server) collects the following information, for the following purposes:]]


## Data transfer outside EEA

This website [["is" or "is not"]] hosted in the European Economic Area. Additionally, the federation feature, described further in the "Advertisement and Other Third Parties" section, 
might result in your data being sent to servers outside the European Economic Area if you decide to enable it for anything you publish to the website.

## Data export, data storage duration

You can download a copy of your data. 
To do so, go to the settings (the cogwheel button in the upper right corner), then navigate to the tab 
'Privacy and Security', select the format and click the 'Export' button.

Your data is stored for as long as you keep an account on [[Instance name]]
or until you delete specific parts of it. Please note that for federated data, we cannot 
guarantee that it will be actually deleted from the remote server.

## Cookies

This website uses cookies for the purposes of preventing abuse, session and preference management. No third party or tracking cookies are used.

## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

This website relies on donations and in the future, marketplace fees as it's sole source of revenue. No data is explicitly shared with third parties for marketing or tracking purposes. 

This website implements the ActivityPub protocol, which allows content from other supported software to be accessible via this website and vice versa. This concept is called _federation_. 
Content that uses this feature is called _federated_.

When you publish something, you are able to choose whether it will federate or not. You can also decide if your account will be visible for the users of other instances.

Please note that due to it's design, there is no way to ensure that a deletion request in ActivityPub will be honored, i.e. a remote federated content might still persist on a third party's server to which it has federated. In this aspect, ActivityPub functions similar to e-mail. In general, this should be honored by any instance not controlled by malicious party. The operator of this instance will perform their due diligence to ensure that such parties are blocked from communicating with [[Instance name]].

This instance is hosted by [[hosting provider or ISP, if you host on your own hardware]]. By using this instance you accept their privacy policy which can be found [here](link).
